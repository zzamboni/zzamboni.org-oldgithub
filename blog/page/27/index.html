    <p>As usual, awesome photo set from TBP, showing some of the good, the bad and the superbad of 2009. Photo 39 (above) is absolutely heartbreaking. &#8220;Why isn&#8217;t dad reaching back to me?&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content">I want to post a short update aimed at users of my iPhoto plugin <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/code/copperexport/" target="_blank">CopperExport</a>. I have received multiple reports of it failing in recent updates of Snow Leopard, and I have also verified personally that it does not work properly in iPhoto&#8217;09.<br><div class="gmail_quote"> <br>Unfortunately, since <a href="http://blog.zzamboni.org/after-the-move" target="_blank">the big move</a>, I find myself without easy access to a Mac for development (I had a Mac at my previous job, and I use Windows at my new job), which pretty much makes fixing these bugs impossible. Until I get a new machine, I will not be able to provide updates to CopperExport. Of course, if any developers out there want to make the appropriate fixes, I will happily accept patches that you submit, and produce a new release myself.<p></p> I apologize to my users for this not-so-happy state, and I want to assure you that as soon as possible, I will resume development. Thank you for your patience and your support, and for the many kind words you have sent me about the plugin itself.<p></p>  </div>

  <div class="entry-content">So, three weeks after our move back to Mexico, things are going well. We battled some illnesses in the beginning (we got a pretty bad cold), but we are all but recovered now, and we&#8217;ve been extremely busy. We are in the process of finding a place to live, moving from Mexico City (where we arrived, and where my new job started) to Queretaro (where my permanent job will be), buying a car, finding a school for Karina, and many other &#8220;startup tasks&#8221; that need to be done.<p></p> Being back in Mexico has been mostly awesome. Being back in our culture, in our language, is great. After so many years of living in foreign lands, I had honestly forgotten the feeling of understanding every word everyone says, of feeling culturally connected with everyone around me, of not having to worry about work permits, visas, and so many other things. I love the food, I love being closer to family. There are some not-so-nice things that we have to get re-used to, like the traffic in Mexico City (but then, we are moving away from Mexico City), the long lines for many things, and the general hecticness of life (compared to here, life in Switzerland is positively boring :-), but the pros far outweigh the cons.<p></p> Speaking of the new job, I promised I would disclose it at some point, so here it is (although many people have already seen the update in <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/zzamboni">my LinkedIn profile </a>a couple of weeks ago). I&#8217;m now working for HP Mexico (*gasp* the competition!) as an IT Delivery Consultant in the Outsourcing group. I&#8217;m barely getting started with the real job, but it has been very interesting, although dramatically different from my old job at IBM Research. I&#8217;m very excited because it gives me an opportunity to learn a whole new set of skills, while actually making use of many of the things I have learned over the years about security, virtualization, system administration, etc. I&#8217;m in a customer-facing position now, which means I have to wear a suit to work most of the time. I have to use Windows on my machine, which has been a challenge (those who follow me on Twitter have already endured a lot of my whining). I&#8217;m really happy to have taken this step, and I&#8217;m certain my career will evolve in very interesting directions.<p></p> Anyway, enough rambling for now. Today was a holiday, so tomorrow is my first actual day of work in Queretaro, I&#8217;d better get some sleep.

  <div class="entry-content">For a few weeks now, all of mine and my family&#8217;s online presence and services have been running exclusively using free services. Before, we shared a rented server with some friends, and that server hosted all the services provided by all of our domains: <a href="http://zzamboni.org" target="_blank">zzamboni.org</a>, <a href="http://sorianoramirez.org" target="_blank">sorianoramirez.org</a>, <a href="http://newmoms.ch" target="_blank">newmoms.ch</a> and <a href="http://virtsecurity.org" target="_blank">virtsecurity.org</a>. <p></p>
<div>Now, with our <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/2009/09/08/going-home/">moving to a different country and all that</a>, we decided to eliminate the need to rent a server, and even reduce costs in the process. The fact that this transition could be done without breaking any previously existing links is a testament to the flexibility of the services and the infrastructure.</div> <p></p>
<div>The one big change I decided to make was to retire my <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/">old blog (BrT) </a>and some other private blogs, and start them anew in <a href="http://posterous.com" target="_blank">posterous.com</a>. I decided this mostly to avoid having to deal with import issues from Wordpress into Posterous, and because I wanted to use Posterous - otherwise I could have migrated to <a href="http://Wordpress.com" target="_blank">Wordpress.com</a> and kept things essentially the same. However, I made static versions of the old sites, so that existing links don&#8217;t break.</div> <p></p>
<div>Here&#8217;s the new setup for <a href="http://zzamboni.org" target="_blank">zzamboni.org</a> (the most complex one):</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<div>
<b>Email</b>: served by <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Google Apps for your domain, standard edition</a>. It was nice that I could upgrade to a 30-day trial version of the Premium Edition, which allowed me to use the IMAP migration tool to migrate all of our users&#8217; email (we offer email accounts to our families), so that for them the transition was completely transparent, apart from getting a new and much nicer web interface (most of our users, except for my wife and me, access their email through the web and not IMAP, we were using <a href="http://roundcube.net/">Roundcube </a>email before, which is quite nice, but certainly not as nice as the Gmail UI).</div> </li>
<li>
<b>Blogs</b>: served by <a href="http://posterous.com" target="_blank">posterous.com</a>, an amazing small company that allows you to post anything by email, doing the &#8220;right thing&#8221; with embedded media, URLs to many sites, etc. My <a href="http://blog.zzamboni.org/">new blog (Ideally Blue)</a>, and some private family blogs, are served by Posterous now.</li> <li>
<b>Old web sites</b>: served by <a href="https://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a> using <a href="http://drydrop.binaryage.com/">DryDrop</a>. As I said before, this includes my old blog BrT and some private blogs and web sites. I made static copies of them using wget by following <a href="http://www.suodatin.com/fathom/How-to-retire-a-wordpress-blog-%28make-wordpress-a-static-site%29">these instructions</a>, put them on per-domain <a href="http://github.com/zzamboni">GitHub </a>repositories, created as many GAE instances, installed DryDrop on them, and configured it to access the corresponding Git repos. I had to make some changes to the DryDrop code to make it serve index.html by default on all directories. I&#8217;m still working on this code, but I will be publishing my changes in <a href="http://github.com/zzamboni/drydrop">my fork of the DryDrop repository</a>.</li> <li>
<b>Project pages</b>: I maintain a <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/code/copperexport/">few </a><a href="http://grabcartoons.sourceforge.net/">open</a>-<a href="http://mailer.sourceforge.net/">source </a><a href="http://zzamboni.github.com/things2thl/">projects </a>whose web pages and code repositories  have been sometimes hosted by myself (e.g. <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/code/copperexport/">CopperExport</a>), in <a href="http://sourceforge.net" target="_blank">sourceforge.net</a>, <a href="http://berlios.de" target="_blank">berlios.de</a> or <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a>. I am in the process of moving all of them to GitHub.</li> </ul>That&#8217;s about it. The other domains saw similar (albeit simpler) transitions. For <a href="http://zzamboni.org">zzamboni.org</a>, my ultimate goal is to have a completely transparent experience, where everything is available inside the <a href="http://zzamboni.org">zzamboni.org</a> domain, with a common look-and-feel, even though different pieces are served from different places. I haven&#8217;t had much time since the move to work on it, so things are still a bit disparate.<p> My overall impression is that the transitions was fairly simple. Most of the time went in planning, and in finding out how the different services work. I have to say I&#8217;m profoundly impressed by the quality and reliability of the free services available online, not only from Google, but also from smaller companies like Posterous. They make it quite possible to have a strong and reliable online presence without spending much money. As of now, our only expenses are the domain registration fees!</p>
